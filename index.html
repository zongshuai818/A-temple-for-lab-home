I am a first year PhD student at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam. I am interested in teaching machines to discover entities and relations in data, assisted by and improving upon background knowledge. 
<br/><br/>

I received an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam. In <a href="assets/dd_thesis.pdf">my master's thesis</a> I studied the problem of unsupervised representation learning for graphs, under the supervision of Thomas Kipf.

In 2017 I created <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deltaphi.drumatefree" target="_blank">Drumate</a>, an Android app for drummers that uses procedural generation of practice patterns, that as of today has about 100k downloads.

I share some of the things I learn here in the form of blog posts. Feel free to visit the Writing section!
